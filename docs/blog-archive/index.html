Neither to stray nor to follow<br />
February 4 to 26 2011<br />
Vernissage: Thursday, February 3 at 6 pm </p>
<p>The McClure Gallery is pleased to present the exhibition Neither to stray nor to follow, featuring the paintings of Mark Dixon, Cecile Ronc and Sébastien Worsnip. The title is taken from a Chinese maxim and references landscape and the elements of nature as a primary source of artistic inspiration. The maxim well represents the artists’ approach to painting, all of which tend towards abstraction without, however, completely abandoning an evocation of landscape. </p>
<p>In preparation for the exhibition, Dixon, Ronc and Worsnip met regularly to exchange ideas, report on their works in progress and to engage in and provoke a more profound reflection on an art practice that focuses on a theme as ancient as painting itself. The artists have sought in their works to evoke more than to represent, to question the illusory nature of pictorial space as well as to permit the co-existence of several visual languages. They also sought to bring particular attention to the tactile aspect of paint and colour as expressions of the link between landscape and the inner life of the psyche.</p>
<p>La galerie McClure a le plaisir de présenter l’exposition Ni quitter ni coller des peintres Mark Dixon, Cécile Ronc et Sébastien Worsnip. Le titre de ce projet est issu d’une maxime chinoise et fait référence à la source d’inspiration première des artistes : le paysage et les éléments naturels. En effet, ceux-ci leur servent de prétextes à des explorations formelles qui tendent vers l’abstraction sans jamais quitter l’évocation du paysage. </p>
<p>Dixon, Ronc et Worsnip se rencontrent régulièrement pour échanger sur leur travail. Il en ressort une importante réflexion sur des pratiques intéressées par un sujet aussi ancien que la peinture elle-même. Les artistes recherchent dans leurs œuvres : « […] à évoquer plutôt qu’à représenter, à figurer ; à suggérer des espaces multiples et contradictoires au sein d’un même espace pictural illusoire, à faire coexister plusieurs langages visuels, à accorder une attention particulière à l’aspect tactile de la peinture et une place privilégiée à la couleur comme expression des liens entre le paysage et la vie psychique…»</p>

<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s a heartwarming art story from The Economist, of all places. In 1993, two students at Frankfurt&#8217;s art school (StÃ¤delschule) each gave the caretaker a painting for his 50th birthday. Somehow, it became a tradition for students to give the caretaker and his wife a painting at graduation. By now, the couple have a superb art collection &#8212; much of it valuable, none of it for sale, with none of the acquistions based on anything but personal affection. </p></blockquote>

<p>I found this interesting article via the art blog <a href="http://bloggy.com/">bloggy </a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, instead of a cultural crisis, weâ€™re facing a paradigm shift. Thanks to the Internet, the monopoly of the elites and the publishing empires they represent are crumbling, and if the blinders imposed by the powers that be havenâ€™t yet been pried off, they have at least, for the moment, been bent back. If you donâ€™t believe in democracy, this is a problem. If you do, then this is could be the dawning of a new golden age. Anyone who visits websites like artnet.com, artforum.com, or our own brooklynrail.org, is aware of the vast amount of valuable content on the net. Within the past few years individual art bloggers have appeared. As a confirmed contrarian, committed to opposing any structure whatsoever, the idea of a venue where the only limitations are an individualâ€™s intellect, energy, and time is very appealing. Though the list of people writing and creating forums for discussions in cyberspace is long, indeed very long, for the purposes of this article I interviewed three who have made unique innovations.</p></blockquote>

I have not been that regular with my own posts and at the same time have been reading less blogs. Do any of you have suggestions for good blogs to read? Add a comment and let me know &#8211; I would like to find some new ones to check out.</p>
<p>On the painting side of things I have been trying a few new things. Last week I started a portrait of J. If it improves I will post it here &#8211; but how it stands now I am not that happy with it. I used to do quite a bit of life drawing and painting from the model in my undergrad studies but have not in the last long while. It makes me realize how drawing or painting from life is a skill the requires  continued practice.</p>

From the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060220.ANSELM20/TPStory/Entertainment">review </a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The artist&#8217;s work is thus understood as creating the bridge between two realms through the very palpable and earthly medium of paint &#8212; soil impregnated with pigment and oil. It&#8217;s our cue to understand Kiefer&#8217;s attachment to the landscape, and more particularly, the scoured and plowed field, as a recurring subject in his art. The field is humble matter &#8212; paint, mud, the rotted remains of the past &#8212; from which we reach and strive.</p></blockquote>

I think I will change my homepage on my browser to another page &#8211; it used to be Google Canada&#8217;s site.</p>
<blockquote><p>Typing â€œDalai Lamaâ€ into Google&#8217;s U.S. Web site yields dozens of pages of results on the 14th Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet. Top results include his Web site, his biography and news of his appearances around the world.</p>
<p>The same search using Google.cn yields none of those sites. Instead, Chinese users get headlines such as â€œDalai Lama unpopular among Tibetans: chairman of Tibet,â€ and â€œDalai Lama Aims to Split Motherland.â€<br />

<p><img class="lazy" data-src="/images/vote_canada.gif" alt="Canada vote, popular vote compared to seat distribution" /></p>
<p>In the Quebec results, all the parties are at a disadvantage exept for the Bloc Quebecois. The Bloc gets 42 % of the popular vote but wins 68 % of the seats.<br />

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Canadian Ballot recipes</h3><p>2006-01-23</p><p><p>Today is election day in Canada and most people I talk to are quite nervous of the out come. If polls are correct (they often are not) then we will be waking up to a conservative government tomorrow morning. On this note, I think that we should be able to spoil our ballots and have them counted. This would allow people to express themselves in a positive way (instead of not voting because there are no acceptable options). The percentage of spoiled  or &#8216;none of the above&#8217; ballots should then be released with the official results of each riding. </p>
<p>I am not referring to the <a href="http://edibleballot.tao.ca">eat your ballot</a> option. An interesting option but it may cause strange digestive problems &#8211; just think of all that black ink. </p>
<p>In Canada it is actually illegal to spoil your ballot (I assume that eating it is also illegal).</p>
<blockquote><p>According to section 167(2)(a) of the Canada Elections Act, &#8220;no person shall wilfully alter, deface or destroy a ballot.&#8221; Subsection 480(1) of the Act also provides that every person is guilty of an offence who, with the intention of delaying or obstructing the electoral process, contravenes this Act.</p></blockquote>

On saturday we roamed around manhattan with no real plan. We happened upon <a href="http://www.deitch.com/projects/project_images.php?slideShowId=244&#038;projId=171">The Deitch Project first annual Art Parade</a> in SOHO in the afternoon. It was a fun, goofy, crazy event.  Perhaps Montreal is in need of something like this. </p>
<p>Update : found <a href="http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/people/laster/laster9-14-05.asp">this link</a> for more photos of the parade.</p>
<p><img class="lazy" data-src="/images/r_wolfe.jpg" alt="Ryan Wolfe" align="left" style="margin-right: 5px;"  />On Sunday we walked around Williamsburg area and saw quite a few galleries.  One highlight was the <a href="http://blackandwhiteartgallery.com/">Black and White Gallery</a>.  The gallery has a great courtyard which had a very nice photo installed on the back wall (see right photo). </p>
<p>Another interesting show was at <a href="http://www.damstuhltrager.com">Dam Stuhltrager</a>.  Ryan Wolfe&#8217;s computerised grass blowing in the wind was simple and beautiful. It did, however, remind me a lot of sculpture done by the artist <a href="http://collections.ic.gc.ca/mercer/273.html">Doug Buis</a>. Novelty is over-rated anyhow. (see left photo)</p>

<p>Justin Laku founder of Canadian Friends of Sudan recently paid a four-day visit to three refugee camps outside of El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In comparison, the condition of a Canadian zoo is 10 times better,&#8221; Ottawa resident Laku said of the camps. &#8220;There is no water, no sanitation, no toilets, nothing whatsoever.&#8221;<br />

<p>The Bush administration still shares intelligence with the Sudan government even after it has stated that they have been commiting genocide. Their reasoning is that is neccessary in the &#8216;war on terror&#8217;. What else are they going to justify with this so called war?</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bush administration described the Darfur atrocities as genocide in order to please the Christian right ahead of the American presidential elections, according to a senior US official.<br />

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>referendums are stupid</h3><p>2005-06-16</p><p><p>A friend forwarded me an email to vote online for the &#8220;<a href="http://www.referendumcanada.ca/uficanada/referendum/">The National Marriage Referendum : Should Parliament pass Bill C-38 to legalize same-sex marriage in Canada?</a>&#8220;. </p>
<p>After visiting the site and seeing the Yes votes out voted by the No votes my immedaite reaction was to vote Yes and forward the site link to as many like minded people I know. But I am undecided if I am going to vote as I believe that questions of such matter should not be decided with a referendum. The rights of a minority should never be decided by the majority. Even more, if a right is protected by <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">The Charter</a>, then it is guaranteed, no matter what the out come of a referendum. </p>
<p>The logic of a referendum is such that the majority can deny or take away the rights of a minority. I hope the Liberals do not bow to the Conservatives pressure to <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050616.wbudge0616/BNStory/National/">delay the vote</a> on gay marriage.  Have a back bone and stand up for what you believe in.</p>
<p>I am undecided. I want to see the Yes votes increase but I do not agree with the principle of a referendum.</p>
<p>Note : the site that is organising this online referendum is &#8220;the Defend Marriage Project of United Families Canada.&#8221;</p>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Sustaining Abstract Painting</h3><p>2005-06-10</p><p><p>I like these few sentences from Donald Kuspit&#8217;s review of Wlodzimierz Ksiazek&#8217;s abstract paintings. I was unfamiliar with Ksiazek&#8217;s work and  am now intrigued by the physicality of his  paintings. I have always thought that one of painting&#8217;s great capacities is its ability to both illustrate and at the same time be a very physical medium. I like this duality and play with it in my paintings.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am suggesting that from the start Ksiazek realized that two-dimensionality and three-dimensionality are inseparable &#8212; one always implies the other &#8212; and that the priority that modernist painting gave to flat painting, by reason of its &#8220;critical&#8221; relationship to the flatness of the canvas, is a reductive premise and falsifying limitation of painting, that is, an inhibiting and peculiarly naive &#8220;formalism.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The reason that art in the postmodern, existential world has reached something of a culdesac is not that art itself is exhausted, but that the existential worldview is.  Just as rational modernity previously exhausted its forms and gave way to aperspectival postmodernity, so now the postmodern itself is on a morbid death watch, with nothing but infinitely mirrored irony to hold its hand, casting flowers where they will not be missed.  The skull of postmodernity grins on the near horizon, and in the meantime, we are between two worldviews, one slowly dying, one not yet born.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Of course, most of us probably didn&#8217;t recognize that we were latecomers to the grad-school pyramid scheme. Theory with a capital T grew up with the expansion of graduate programs and the adjunctification of higer education during the last 30 years. It was a ticket to success for a charmed circle of insiders: a few people at elite institutions with the connections and advance knowledge to get in and out of the game before the general rush. The language of theory &#8211; carefully deployed in the world of academic hiring and publication &#8211; still functions in ways that suggest the sub rosa communications of Ivy League clubmen in the world of investment banking.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Beck&#8217;s Futures, I have come to realise, is a satire on the emptiness of prizes and the idiocy of art.</p></blockquote>
<p>Christina Mackie has won the Beck&#8217;s Futures Art Award (London). I am writing about this for a few reasons. One is the amount of money it comes with &#8211; $63 275.00 (in Canadian dollars), which is fairly substantial. The Canada Council reserves this type of support to senior artists. Another is that it seems she grew up in Canada (for some reason most of the articles mention this). And there is this scathing article thatnot only slams her art work but also the premise of the prize.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mackie&#8217;s work would not make you look twice in a mediocre group show.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It seems that the sillier art becomes, the more money gets thrown into its void. You know, some people actually do create works of art that are engaging, complex, and multi-layered.</p></blockquote>
<p>I cannot remember the general tone of Jonathan Jones&#8217; previous reviews and/or articles but it makes me want to pay attention to his further writings. Not because he is somewhat vicious but because it seeme that he is not afraid to express ideas that could be interpreted as anti-intellectual or anti-avant-garde.</p>

<p>another hybrid drawing (started on <a href="/images/squiggle2.jpg">paper</a> and then edited on the computer).  i would like to start some drawings on the computer and then re-work them on paper. perhaps even continue back into the original medium (i.e. from paper to computer and back to paper). this will entail a fairly good quality print though, especially if it is re-worked and re-scanned again. i wonder how many &#8216;generations&#8217; i can take it&#8230;</p>

<p>this idea for a landscape painting was stolen from N (he is six years old).  i was amazed when he drew a swath of darker colour to show the wet sand.  i have several ideas for a new landscape series and am eager to get them started. </p>

<p>j and i went to the adirondack mountains this weekend. it was fabulous. the weather was great and the camping and hiking area even better. the above photo was taken from the top of mount jo. i didn&#8217;t bring a camera and found the photo on the web <a href="http://www.union.edu/PUBLIC/GEODEPT/COURSES/petrology/fieldtrips/fieldtrips2002.htm">here</a> after doing a <a href="http://images.google.ca/images?hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;q=mount+jo+">google search</a>. we spent a long time lying in the sun and looking at this view. i searched for a picture of the view from our campsite on heart lake (the lake in the lower part of the picture) but have not found one yet.  interesting that there are certain places in the world that have been captured in pictures by many people. of course the view was quite different yesterday but the picture is surprisingly similar (there were no leaves on the trees and a bit of snow at higher elevations). the sky was different though and there was a bit of ice still on the northern edge of the lake. i prefer my mental image.</p>

<blockquote><p>The 31 paintings in Damien Hirst&#8217;s sad new show at Gagosian are not paintings at all; or rather, they&#8217;re generic-to-bad photo-realist efforts. Any semi-adept student or average commercial artist could have made them. Many do. But this isn&#8217;t what makes Hirst&#8217;s paintings sad; it only makes them ordinary and academic.<br />
from <a href="http://www.artnet.com/Magazine//features/jsaltz/saltz4-6-05.asp">The Emperor&#8217;s New Paintings by Jerry Saltz</a></p></blockquote>
<p>it is not the avant garde aspect of his work that annoys me but the simplistic shock reaction that he seems to searh for. it is easy to shock and it is a one-liner. what is even worse is the art world&#8217;s taking of his work hook, line and sinker. not only is his work praised in many art theory books but his work sells very well. the works in this show go for between a quarter million and two million. not bad work if you can get it. why don&#8217;t these art collectors (speculators) look a bit more at less blue chip artist? spread the interest and wealth a bit. </p>
<blockquote><p>Seeing Hirst rehash his old subjects in such pale ways is like listening to Paul McCartney sing Beatles songs in Wings.</p></blockquote>

There is an interesting article on the work (and the person) of Cy Twombly. I have never really had a decisive viewpoint on what I think of his work but I have always been intrigued by it. I think more and more. His gestural marks (that some people call doodles) are very immediate and casual. At the same time they are quite serious and create a situation of pause and reflection.  Randomness has interested me for quite some time. I do not refer to randomness in the sense of putting down whatever but more of a state where the discursive mind is less present. Perhaps openness is a better term. My work usually swings from randomness (gestural) to more contrived editing. </p>
<blockquote><p>Nobody, however, could erect a theory on Twombly&#8217;s images. They are not just products of the imagination; they do not exist as correlatives to ideas, let alone to things. Done in pencil and crayon, Twombly&#8217;s trademark images capture the transient, universal sign of distraction: the doodle.</p></blockquote>

i deliberated if i should post this drawing. i am not sure what i think of it &#8211; whether is good or what it suggests. the reason for this blog however, is to post things from my sketchbook and not to edit too much. many of the things i put down on paper are not very interesting (ideas or drawings) but it is helpful to put them down. often i find it cathartic to get rid of the forms that i think of in my head. if i don&#8217;t draw them they remain there and take up space and sometimes cause stress. so here it is, an unedited look. <br clear="all"></p>

There is no good work of art that cannot be described in intelligible English, however long it might take, however much patience is required. And yet this book begins with four theoretical essays explaining the post-structuralist concepts the authors believe we need before we can meaningfully discuss a single work of art.</p></blockquote>
<p>I came across this article (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,1443874,00.html">Lost in a labyrinth of theory</a>)  via another art blog (<a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/man/">Modern Art Notes</a>).  It is true that I am often annoyed with the extent or importance that is put on theory in the art world. Often it seems as if the theory is not there to describe or investigate the art but that the art is there to elucidate the theory. At the same time a certain amount of specialized language is required. </p>

Digital image</p>
<p>it is not very often that i create images digitally but this is an example. at times i work through various possibilities digitally but usually i do so in the studio or in my sketchbook. but as this blog has become somewhat of a working sketchbook, i think there are ways to experiment with imagery, colour, etc. using the computer. even if i come up with interesting ideas in this way i feel that the true test is how it will look when made into a &#8216;real&#8217; painting. it is hard to ignore, especially for me, paint&#8217;s physical quality. i have wrote these thoughts before and perhaps it is me making excuses for spending time on these digital, or web-based, images. this being said, i think that this &#8216;sketch&#8217; (there are  the quotation marks again) could make for an interesting avenue to explore on canvas.</p>

: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, what is left to find in painting? Quite frankly, in the context of Postmodernism,<br />
    rather too much. While the constant refinement of Modernist abstraction is<br />
    now an old story, the pluralism that so happily succeeded it seems increasingly<br />
    unmoored. The freedom of Postmodern painters is in the advocacy of their caprices.<br />
    In other words, they get to paint whatever they want however the hell they<br />
    want, and don&#8217;t mind us, we&#8217;ll find a way to stomach it somehow. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was surprised and glad to read this review of a show on ArtNet.com. Has the<br />
&#8216;freedom of Postmodern painters&#8217; caused them to become more unmoored than Modernist<br />
painters at the turn of the century supposedly did? I am not sure. The pluralism of so called<br />
Postmodern painters obviously irks this reviewer. It makes me wonder if he would<br />
express similar sentiments if he were reviewing a show of &#8216;Modernist&#8217; painting<br />
as painters diverged from figurative work.</p>

I was thinking of what it means to view images of art work posted on web sites in lieu of experiencing them in person. On Chris Ashley&#8217;s site he has an article someone wrote about his &#8216;paintings&#8217; that I found interesting.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chris Ashley is a painter. That’s the first thing I want to say, and as it may turn out, the most radical, because he creates his color images without paint. Ashley uses HTML (hypertext markup language), the original and rudimentary instructional software of the internet, and delivers the results to his audience via the web. No brushes to clean. No walls to leave nail holes in. His studio/gallery is, in the parlance, a Blog, an online journal he maintains on a day to day basis.<br /><a href="http://www.chrisashley.net/weblog/archives/week_2004_10_10.html#000494" target="new">George Lawson: Chris Ashley’s HTML Drawings</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I have always found that the physical aspect of my paintings to be very important (as most or all paintings). At the same time my paintings have been experienced only by seeing images on a screen. In fact I have sold paintings based on people viewing images on my web site. Perhaps the &#8216;flattening&#8217; of painting on the web happens with many other areas as well (journalism, literature, etc.).</p>
<blockquote><p>There are philosophical implications to the virtual reality, the non-physical aspect of these HTML images. Rather than painting, one might call them coding, and one could ask angel-on-a-pinhead questions like, “What direction is the light coming from?” and, “How big are they?” They don’t conform to painting’s standard vocabulary, deriving their color as they do neither from mass tone nor undertone. </p></blockquote>

The author,  Bernard Avishai, who went to McGill University, elucidates several views on the Israel/Palestine problem. These viewpoints are not usually seen in mainstream media, or in media that requires any great depth or history. </p>
<blockquote><p>Worse, there is an obvious way to safeguard a “Jewish majority” that hardly comes up in conversations, though the way most Israelis now grasp their history should give us pause. I mean ha’transfer, reducing by forced expulsion or economic pressure the numbers of Arabs living where Jews do. The fact is, it is impossible to get the “clean” separation Goldberg speaks of without extensive ethnic cleansing. And Israelis know this.<br /><a href="http://harpers.org/SavingIsraelFromItself.html">Harpers article</a></p></blockquote>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>The End of Suburbia (I wish)</h3><p>2004-12-20</p><p><p>I came accross a link to this documentary on another blog (I can&#8217;t remember which). It looks very interesting. It investigates the problematics of suburbia &#8211; a topic that I have had an interest for some time. I think that this type of (sub)urban planning creates dead communities. Vast areas of asphalt and manicured lawns where everyone drives around in cars. Have you ever walked through a suburb? You seem very out of place as a pedestrian &#8211; chances are, you are the only one walking. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.endofsuburbia.com/">THE END OF SUBURBIA: Oil Depletion and the Collapse of The American Dream</a></p>
<blockquote><p>But as we enter the 21st century, serious questions are beginning to emerge about the sustainability of this way of life. With brutal honesty and a touch of irony, The End of Suburbia explores the American Way of Life and its prospects as the planet approaches a critical era, as global demand for fossil fuels begins to outstrip supply. World Oil Peak and the inevitable decline of fossil fuels are upon us now, some scientists and policy makers argue in this documentary.</p></blockquote>

<p>i took this drawing out to show someone at the studio the other week. it is interesting to look at your work from a distance of many years. it is almost as if it has been made by someone else. at the same time i can see marks and remember making them &#8211; or remember what i was doing (that day, week) when i made it. for this drawing, i can picture what time of day i made it and bright sunny light in my studio.</p>
</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Keeping Art Dangerous</h3><p>2004-12-13</p><p><p>If you spend any time walking around the Mile-End or Plateau region of Montreal you have surely seen some of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zekesgallery/sets/13388/show/" target="new">Roadworth&#8217;s stencil art</a>. Apparently he was busted and charged with 85 counts of public mischief. </p>
<p>Zeke, of Zeke&#8217;s Gallery has started a (email) <a href="http://zekesgallery.blogspot.com/2004/12/free-roadsworth.html" target="new">campaign</a> to have  his interventions considered art and not common vandalism. It is an interesting debate &#8211; when does something become art and when is it graffiti? At the same time, part of what makes his art works interesting is that they <b>are</b> illegal and have to be made in a very covert way. The illegality of the work removes it from the institution of art (i.e. galleries or sanctioned art venue). I do not want him to get punished too harshly but at the same time I feel that having the city or the police sanction his interventions as Art will, for me, lessen the work. A large part of the impact is that it is rebellious, unsanctioned and clandestine. </p>
<p>I really like his stencils and find that they are often very clever. It is nice when art interjects itself into common, pedestrian venues. There is an especially clever stencil on Fairmount, just east of St Laurent &#8211; a vine wraps around the shadow of a lampost (cast from a street light).</p>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="http://www.montrealmirror.com/2004/120904/front.html" target="new">Montreal Mirror</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The zipper on Parc above the interchange, the light switch on St-Laurent and St-Viateur, the vines at St-Urbain and St-Joseph; these are some of the unique signature pieces by Montreal stencil artist sensation Roadsworth. While widely praised for bringing some life onto Montreal&#8217;s otherwise drab and potholed Plateau streets, Roadsworth&#8217;s popularity didn&#8217;t save him from being arrested last week by Montreal police.</p></blockquote>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Open Letter to a Bike Thief</h3><p>2004-11-24</p><p><p>Ok, this is not an open letter to just any bike thief. It is, rather, an open letter to the bike thief who stole my bike this morning. The bike thief that stole my bike a little over a year ago may also consider this addressed to him or her (although I suspect it is a him).</p>
<p>First of all, fuck you. I used that bike for my main mode of transportation. It was not a luxurious toy.  When I saw my crumpled bike lock where my bike used to be this morning, I was on my way to work. Thanks to you I was late. </p>
<p>I think there are levels of thieves and you my friend are near the bottom. You remind me of horse thieves and how they were considered to exist on the lowest level of thief-dom. You should be punished not only for the value in dollars that you steal but for the fact that you are stealing someones mode of transportation. Car thieves get their own category don&#8217;t they? Why not you as well? Perhaps you should have to work in a bike shop for free. Or volunteer for an alternative transportation group like Critical Mass.</p>
<p>So tell me, how much did you get for it? Was it worth it? Did you buy crack? A 40 ouncer? It would make me feel better if you bought some new shoes  for your kid but somehow I think that your motive was less noble. </p>
<p>P.S. &#8211; fuck you.</p>

It is suprising that this type of swaying is allowed on the day of election. Shouldn&#8217;t there be a free and unhindered atmosphere at the polling stations? </p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_04/103104A.shtml" target="new">Truth Out</a> :</p>
<blockquote><p>With political analysts agreeing that voter turnout, especially of minority and youth voters, will likely determine the outcome of next Tuesday&#8217;s presidential election, civil and human rights groups are pressing the Republican National Committee (RNC) to call off plans aimed at discouraging people from casting ballots.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the US version of democracy should be fixed before it is spread around the world. From <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/metro/20041031-115519-8720r.htm" target="new">The Washington Post</a> :</p>
<blockquote><p>Precincts in Virginia and Maryland will allow international observers to monitor the election process tomorrow, despite concerns from local voters who say such a presence undermines U.S. sovereignty.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michael Moore is asking people to document cases of election fraud with their video cameras. This <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php?id=274" target="new">article</a> was also published in The Guardian :</p>
<blockquote><p>The filmmaker Michael Moore has announced a large-scale effort to combat dirty tricks during tomorrow&#8217;s US election by stationing hundreds of people with video cameras outside polling stations.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>And the final twist is that Atlantic Canada is not “poor.” That, too, is relative. The word only comes up because others are filthy rich. If we look at it in world terms, we are in fact mostly filthy rich ourselves. Figures from the World Bank indicate this: <b>If you make $25,000 a year, you&#8217;re in the top 10 per cent of wage earners on the face of the Earth.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>It is taken from an <a href="http://www.rabble.ca/news_full_story.shtml?sh_itm=c10725c8fdcf1aaa387615b62ba520c2&#038;r=1" target="new">article</a> that features the result of a study on the happiness of Canadians.

<p>The idea for this blog started as a place to post images from my sketchbook. While it has remained this to a large extent, it expanded in scope as well. I also have been posting images of works in progress from time to time. From this I have developed a method of working where I work on images of unfinished paintings in Photoshop before continuing with them in the studio. Furthermore, I am also posting a fair amount of material in the Politics and Ideas section. These are mostly articles that I come accross in my reading of numerous web sites. And lastly I also post things from my trips or general life in the Day to Day section.</p>

i had finished this painting a few months ago but this weekend i thought that it may not be finished. i may try my new method of working (studies) possibilities out using photoshop. it may need a strong graphic element in the foreground to break things up a bit. until then, it remains as it is above. not title as of yet (big surprise), about 50 x 50 cm, oil on canvas.</p>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Bush and the NY Times</h3><p>2004-10-19</p><p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html">Here</a> is an informative article that was printed in the NY Times a few days ago. The newspaper has openly declared their supprot for Kerry in the upcoming election (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/opinion/17sun1.html?ex=1255752000&#38;en=29df467441c52478&#38;ei=5088&#38;partner=rssnyt">John Kerry for President</a>). To view these articles you will need to sign up (for free). This is an anecdote from the first mentioned story:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is one story about Bush&#8217;s particular brand of certainty I am able to piece together and tell for the record.</p>
<p>In the Oval Office in December 2002, the president met with a few ranking senators and members of the House, both Republicans and Democrats. In those days, there were high hopes that the United States-sponsored &#8221;road map&#8221; for the Israelis and Palestinians would be a pathway to peace, and the discussion that wintry day was, in part, about countries providing peacekeeping forces in the region. The problem, everyone agreed, was that a number of European countries, like France and Germany, had armies that were not trusted by either the Israelis or Palestinians. One congressman &#8212; the Hungarian-born Tom Lantos, a Democrat from California and the only Holocaust survivor in Congress &#8212; mentioned that the Scandinavian countries were viewed more positively. Lantos went on to describe for the president how the Swedish Army might be an ideal candidate to anchor a small peacekeeping force on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Sweden has a well-trained force of about 25,000. The president looked at him appraisingly, several people in the room recall.</p>
<p>&#8221;I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re talking about Sweden,&#8221; Bush said. &#8221;They&#8217;re the neutral one. They don&#8217;t have an army.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lantos paused, a little shocked, and offered a gentlemanly reply: &#8221;Mr. President, you may have thought that I said Switzerland. They&#8217;re the ones that are historically neutral, without an army.&#8221; Then Lantos mentioned, in a gracious aside, that the Swiss do have a tough national guard to protect the country in the event of invasion.</p>
<p>Bush held to his view. &#8221;No, no, it&#8217;s Sweden that has no army.&#8221;</p>
<p>The room went silent, until someone changed the subject.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, members of Congress and their spouses gathered with administration officials and other dignitaries for the White House Christmas party. The president saw Lantos and grabbed him by the shoulder. &#8221;You were right,&#8221; he said, with bonhomie. &#8221;Sweden does have an army.&#8221; </p></blockquote>

i finally finished this painting this afternoon. i struggled a bit with the colour of the dots but i have decided to stick with this hue of pink. <a href="/images/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/on_paper/blue_pink.html">here</a> is a previous post where i was working with the colour using photoshop. the slight yelloe hue added to the pink makes the pink contrast with the blue-grey of the &#8216;background&#8217; a bit better. i withheld from making this painting overly complicated as i feel that it&#8217;s simplicity makes its stronger. there is another painting in this series (that i may post later) that i completely over-worked and am now trying to salvage. although it may be at the point of no return so i will over-work it to death in hopes of something interesting happening in doing so.</p>

i seem to drift between the micro and the macro and not rest in between. what i remember most about visiting places are the close ups of streets, rock, sand, skin. i am still able to see the texture of the streets of madrid, the colour of the rock while climbing in welsford, the cracked plaster over the bed in my old apartment. i can picture the constellation on your back. or the far-reaching vistas, horizon line, mountain contours, cloud formations. the in between views fade away more quickly as if stored in a temporary place to be replaced rugularily.</p>

<p>Klein&#8217;s article :</p>
<blockquote><p>Every policy that liberates multinational corporations to pursue their quest for profit would be put into place: a shrunken  state, a flexible workforce, open borders, minimal taxes, no tariffs, no ownership restrictions. The people of Iraq would,  of course, have to endure some short-term pain: assets, previously owned by the state, would have to be given up to create  new opportunities for growth and investment.<br />

<blockquote><p>Many say that no real avant-garde &#8211; which I&#8217;ll define as a combative group of free-thinking artists &#8211; can exist anymore. The media&#8217;s reach is too vast. New artists and movements get snatched up too quickly. If they are popular they get overexposed and stale. If they are not popular they disappear, and the marketeers decide they had better play it safe next time.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder how this media effect works on the idea of artist becoming successful in their life time. Is the idea that an artist is more likely to become known after they are dead, dead? Perhaps the spread of media has caused our cultural history memory to be shortened &#8211; we remember less but are aware of current art more.</p>
<blockquote><p>Universities are filled with arts programs. The training raises the level of craft and sophistication. It does not necessarily raise the courage quotient &#8211; the likelihood that artists will go their own way despite the rules dictated by the vanguard. &#8230; Postmodernism has the same effect. It drives artists to mine the past constantly &#8211; and flagrantly. </p></blockquote>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>The Democracy Paintings</h3><p>2004-09-17</p><p><p>I have been thinking about a new project called The Democracy Project or The Democracy Paintings. It will be a way to truly combine internet media and painting. I am not sure that my painting would benefit from this &#8216;merger&#8217; but anyhow, here is the idea.</p>
<p>There are times that I post works in progress on my <a href="http://www.markdixon.ca">art web site</a> (<a href="http://www.markdixon.ca">portfolio</a>) even though it is not as regular as I had intitially anticipated or wanted. My idea is to continue with  this in a more regular manner. I will start a series of paintings and then photograph them. For each painting I will work out several (maybe 3) different avenues using PhotoShop. Readers (i.e. people like you) will then vote on which avenue they want the painting to continue in. This will be repeated until the &#8216;voters&#8217; decide that the painting is finished. I did something like this <a href="/images/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/on_paper/study_painting.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>There is something I really like about taking aesthetic judgement away from myself and letting it rest with the majority. It is true that it will not rest entirely with the voters as they will be presented with limited choices but it  could be an interesting exercise. One problem I can foresee (besides no one voting) is that besides <a href="/images/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/on_paper/study_painting.html">this</a> painting, I have never really worked out a painting using digital means. </p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s downright strange that the U.S. presidential election campaign — easily the most important in decades — has come to focus on what happened in a faraway boat during the course of a few minutes more than 30 years ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rick Salutin (who also writes for The Globe and Mail) writes about losing, the Olympics and the nature of communities. Also on <a href="http://www.rabble.ca/columnists_full.shtml?x=33762" target="new">rabble.ca</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Many countries have unifying elements like ethnicity, religion or language. When these are lacking or sparse, as in Canada, that need to belong is so strong that people find a way to identify anyhow, with what have been called “imagined communities,” which also makes sense to me.

It occured to me that the size of these drawings may be a bit of a mystery. Most are around 8.5 x 11 (like this one) &#8211; the size of a page from a medium sized sketchbook. Others are cropped (like yesterday&#8217;s), and thus are smaller.</p>

There are times that these attempts do not work very well but mostly, I think, it is a good tendency. Several hotels have been showing contemporary artists in their lobbies and rooms. The is an article in <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20040823/HOTEL23/TPEntertainment/TopStories" target="new">The Globe and Mail</a> about this. How nice that we are spared looking at the typical cheesy reproductions at these hotels.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hotel art, once the mainstay of washed-out reproduced masterpieces and the butt of bad jokes, has recently acquired a bold new lease on life. Forget the Frette linens, celebrity chefs and Aveda bath products. To stay on top of the game, luxury high-end chains and boutique hotels must now provide their guests with cultural stimulation too, which is why a growing number of hoteliers in Canada and around the world are investing in serious modern-art collections to spice up their designer lobbies.</p></blockquote>

I have scanned a few pages from my previous sketchbook and will post a few here. These drawings were done in the last year or so. It is interesting to go back after a good length of time and look at things one has done. After a certain point the work almost seems like it has been made by someone else. Although I am surprised at how much I remember about the making of a painting. The other week I was moving a few large paintings (that I made around 1994!)that are in storage at my father&#8217;s place. I actually remembered working on certain areas of the painting, choosing colours, etc.</p>
<p>Distance (time) allows one to edit a bit more accurately. This is why I do not like showing work that has only recently been finished. Although it always seems to happen that I am vigourously trying to finish a few paintings before the show starts &#8230;</p>

My sketchbook has not seen a lot of action lately and thus my choices as to what I post has been limited. Here is a a quick drawing of a form that I pictured recently.</p>
</p></div><div class='post'><h3>From Chads to Worse</h3><p>2004-08-16</p><p><p>The US, the champion of democracy, will get election observers for the coming election.</p>

<p>In another related article on rabble.ca, Linda MaQuaig writes about the potential for more election problems in Florida. The plan to use electronic voting machines will make it impossible to do recounts. Given that the the results could be so close this requirement is a true possibility.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, no country likes to admit that its elections need U.N. supervision. But the allegations of black disenfranchisement are so serious and the election so potentially close that the involvement of a neutral body, unconnected to the Bush family, might be useful. </p>

<p>The above fact has not gone unnoticed in Bush&#8217;s Whitehouse to the south. As the<br />
U.S. consumes more and more oil it must look for more reserves. Relying on imports<br />
of oil<br />
from the Middle East has obvious problems (Iraq). There is no doubt that the<br />
U.S.&#8217;s foreign policy is influenced by its oil policy. Given this, what would<br />
this mean to Canada to be supplying a great quantity of oil to our southern neighbours?</p>

The colour combination of this drawing came to me as I was walking home one day. Perhaps something I saw sparked the idea. I remember seeing vividly how it would look. I was not that happy with the result of this drawing. Perhaps it would work better as a large painting &#8211; with the orange &#8216;background&#8217; being somewhat translucent and textured. The above drawing is done with coloured pastels and is about 30 x 26 inches.</p>

Ok, so it is not the most recent drawing (it was done last March). I haven&#8217;t been scanning many pages from my sketchbook lately but I plan to do so soon. I have been busy with many of life&#8217;s distractions lately.</p>
</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Divergent Ideas</h3><p>2004-07-22</p><p><p><img class="lazy" data-src="/images/blosxom/draw_24_march_sm.jpg"><br />
There is not that much that is special about this drawing but I feel like putting up the bad with the good with this project. Often I have the problem of too many diverging ideas for paintings and not enough time (and materials) to start them.</p>
</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Save the Waves</h3><p>2004-07-22</p><p><p>I went to see Jean-Pierre Aubé&#8217;s Save the Waves exhibit at <a href="http://www.quartierephemere.org/fonderie/" target="new">La Fondarie Darling</a> today. It is a sculptural installation that &#8216;captures&#8217; and then plays electrical waves. Here is a better and more detailed description :</p>
<blockquote><p>Summer long, the huge transformer of Hydro Québec, next to the Fonderie Darling, will be under close monitoring. The transformer generates a 60 cycle per second humm, the offical wavelength of the american power grid. This is the sound of electricity, the contemporary soundtrack of our domestic life. It will be captured by 8 VLF antennas implanted in the old Fonderie. <br /><a href="http://www.kloud.org/vlf_soundsystem.html" target="new">www.kloud.org</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though the installation is comprised of large speakers, I found it to be a interesting sculpture to look at. The speakers are made of wood and have an organic feel to them. The main aspect of the work however is the sound element. The space (large and empty) is filled with the humming and droning of the waves the contraption is &#8216;catching&#8217;. At first it seems as though the sound of the waves&#8217; are regular but closer observation reveals that there are slight fluctuations. What I enjoyed most was the harmonics that are created with the overlapping of the deep bass tones (waves) with higher pitched ones. It reminded me of Tibetan throat singing. It was a nice thing to do during my lunch break. I think I should stop by La Fondarie more often, especially given that I work next door.</p>

<p>Often I am intrigued by scientific images that I come accross. It is not very often, however, that these images make their way into the paintings or drawings directly. At times parts of the image or diagram does, however, make it into a painting or inspire it in some way. Sometimes it is a combination of colours other times a forms shape. In this blue image (on the right) I am interested in the space it creates and the possibility it could serve as background or starting point for a new painting. Perhaps someday I will reproduce an image I have found.</p>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Farenheit 9/11</h3><p>2004-07-13</p><p><p>Last week I went to see Michael Moore&#8217;s latest movie. It was interesting to see it after all the news and controversy about it. I enjoyed watching it even though there was not a lot of things that I learned in it. It helps as well that I agree roughly with his politics.</p>
<p>There were times, however, that I found it a bit annoying. It definitely is not a documentary but a commentary piece. His methods are not very sophisticated and he often relies on emotional justaposition of elements to stir his audience. For example he cuts from one series of shots (Bush giving his invasion of Iraq) to another (kids playing in Bagdad). He also uses music in an emotive (and humerous) way as well. I found it a bit surprising that when he was making fun of the supposed &#8220;Coalition of the Willing&#8221; that he fails to mention Britain and Australia. It ends up discrediting the film.</p>
<p>It is worth seeing and I wonder what impact it will have in the Fall election</p>

If seats had been awarded to parties on the basis of the votes they received, the Liberals, Bloc and Conservatives would have had fewer seats and the NDP and Green Party more seats. For example, rather than 135 seats, the Liberals would have received about 113. The NDP, rather than 19 seats would have had about 48. The Greens, rather than no seats, would have had about 12 seats. <br />

It is a privilege not to be hated for your nationality, and we should not relinquish it lightly. George Bush has denied that privilege to his own people, and Stephen Harper would cavalierly strip it from Canadians by erasing what few small but important differences remain between Canadian and U.S. foreign policy. The danger posed by this act is not just about whether Canadians are safe when we travel to the Middle East. The hatred that Bush is manufacturing there, for the United States and its coalition partners, is already following the soldiers home.

But the political framework itself is so dead and closed that people look to other sources, like artists, because art and music allow people a certain freedom. (Thom Yorke) <br />

Canada is one of the countries mentioned. The article mentions Canada&#8217;s liberal stance on such things as medical marijuana and gay marriage. It mentions that Canada is a popular country for Americans to &#8216;escape to&#8217; as it is close and that Canadians speak English. I guess the writer forgot to mention that the second largest province is French speaking. It is a good read &#8211; check it out here:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If Americans are leaving the United States, Canada is certainly one of the most convenient places to go. It may be a little chilly at times, but it&#8217;s right across the border and most Canadians speak English. Many of the major issues that divide people and political parties in the U.S. seem resolved in Canada. They have a lower crime rate, universal health care, and reportedly better education. Their medical doctors can dispense marijuana and last year they decided to officially recognize same-sex marriages. And, on top of all that, the rest of the world isn&#8217;t mad at them.<br />

<p>The plot is inventive and the actors do a good job playing the roles of the various goofy characters. I was especially impressed with Jim Carey. He does not play the wacky, over the top character he normally does. Even though there are funny points in the film, he is actually quite serious and does a good job playing Joel, a shy, and soulful person.</p>

<p>Well there seems to be another small art funding controversy in Canada. The news coverage of the Governor General&#8217;s Awards in several newspapers cites the controversial nature of one of this year&#8217;s winners. He is Istvan Kantor, you know, the guy who paints Xs on the walls of galleries and museums. I am not surprised by the media expressing surprise that an artist such as Kantor would win this 15 000 dollar award but at how superficial their coverage is. They make very little effort to see the work for what it is (to contextualize it). Here is a link to the CBC article (one of the more tame ones I came accross.

One was on Richard Serra and the other on Gerhard Richter. They were both quite refreshing as both of them featured the artists talking about their work.</p>
<p>The Serra film included showed the installation and subsequent planning of a huge peice that he installed on a farm in New Zealand. It is an impressive sculpture (from what I could tell from the film). Not only was the finished sculpture impressive but the planning that was required was very interesting to see. Serra often talks about his peices being a reaction to the landscape. While I do see this point I do think that his peices are a definite imposition on the same space. Not that an imposition is bad.</p>
<p>The film on Richter included interviews with him and other art historians and critics. Mostly, the critic and historians were quite annoying. Richter. however, talks about his work in a very simple and humble way. He mentions that he still does not know what his abstract paintings mean. Often artists seem to overwhelm their work with too many words to try and attempt to explain it. I think it is ok to not know what your own work means and at the same time see value in it and continue to make it.</p>

The Spanish fascist dictatorship led by General Franco was one of the most repressive regimes to have existed in Western Europe in the 20th Century. For every political assassination that took place under the Mussolini regime, Franco assassinated 10,000. The Franco dictatorship was established by the Armed Forces, the Church, the banking community, the large employers, the oligarchic land owners, and sectors of the middle class after a military coup took place in 1936 against a democratically elected government who had enacted major reforms that had injured the pro-Franco groups&#8217; interests.<br />

Neither to stray nor to follow<br />
February 4 to 26 2011<br />
Vernissage: Thursday, February 3 at 6 pm </p>
<p>The McClure Gallery is pleased to present the exhibition Neither to stray nor to follow, featuring the paintings of Mark Dixon, Cecile Ronc and Sébastien Worsnip. The title is taken from a Chinese maxim and references landscape and the elements of nature as a primary source of artistic inspiration. The maxim well represents the artists’ approach to painting, all of which tend towards abstraction without, however, completely abandoning an evocation of landscape. </p>
<p>In preparation for the exhibition, Dixon, Ronc and Worsnip met regularly to exchange ideas, report on their works in progress and to engage in and provoke a more profound reflection on an art practice that focuses on a theme as ancient as painting itself. The artists have sought in their works to evoke more than to represent, to question the illusory nature of pictorial space as well as to permit the co-existence of several visual languages. They also sought to bring particular attention to the tactile aspect of paint and colour as expressions of the link between landscape and the inner life of the psyche.</p>
<p>La galerie McClure a le plaisir de présenter l’exposition Ni quitter ni coller des peintres Mark Dixon, Cécile Ronc et Sébastien Worsnip. Le titre de ce projet est issu d’une maxime chinoise et fait référence à la source d’inspiration première des artistes : le paysage et les éléments naturels. En effet, ceux-ci leur servent de prétextes à des explorations formelles qui tendent vers l’abstraction sans jamais quitter l’évocation du paysage. </p>
<p>Dixon, Ronc et Worsnip se rencontrent régulièrement pour échanger sur leur travail. Il en ressort une importante réflexion sur des pratiques intéressées par un sujet aussi ancien que la peinture elle-même. Les artistes recherchent dans leurs œuvres : « […] à évoquer plutôt qu’à représenter, à figurer ; à suggérer des espaces multiples et contradictoires au sein d’un même espace pictural illusoire, à faire coexister plusieurs langages visuels, à accorder une attention particulière à l’aspect tactile de la peinture et une place privilégiée à la couleur comme expression des liens entre le paysage et la vie psychique…»</p>

<blockquote><p>Here&#8217;s a heartwarming art story from The Economist, of all places. In 1993, two students at Frankfurt&#8217;s art school (StÃ¤delschule) each gave the caretaker a painting for his 50th birthday. Somehow, it became a tradition for students to give the caretaker and his wife a painting at graduation. By now, the couple have a superb art collection &#8212; much of it valuable, none of it for sale, with none of the acquistions based on anything but personal affection. </p></blockquote>

<p>I found this interesting article via the art blog <a href="http://bloggy.com/">bloggy </a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Today, instead of a cultural crisis, weâ€™re facing a paradigm shift. Thanks to the Internet, the monopoly of the elites and the publishing empires they represent are crumbling, and if the blinders imposed by the powers that be havenâ€™t yet been pried off, they have at least, for the moment, been bent back. If you donâ€™t believe in democracy, this is a problem. If you do, then this is could be the dawning of a new golden age. Anyone who visits websites like artnet.com, artforum.com, or our own brooklynrail.org, is aware of the vast amount of valuable content on the net. Within the past few years individual art bloggers have appeared. As a confirmed contrarian, committed to opposing any structure whatsoever, the idea of a venue where the only limitations are an individualâ€™s intellect, energy, and time is very appealing. Though the list of people writing and creating forums for discussions in cyberspace is long, indeed very long, for the purposes of this article I interviewed three who have made unique innovations.</p></blockquote>

St. John River, digital sketch, 2006.</p>
<p>This is a study for a new painting. I am not sure I like the form of the river, but I think that the awkwardness of the shape makes it interesting.</p>
</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Purchase Art Online</h3><p>2007-01-22</p><p><p>I am working on a new section for my portfolio web site where people will be able to purchase small works on paper. They will be easy to ship and not too expensive (and you will be able to pay online). Coming soon.</p>
<p>I am not sure what to call the section, Gallery? Store? Purchase? Buy? The last three seem a bit crass. Suggestions?</p>
</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Without images</h3><p>2007-01-12</p><p><p>Recently I have been in a non-blog period. I have not been that regular with my own posts and at the same time have been reading less blogs. Do any of you have suggestions for good blogs to read? Add a comment and let me know &#8211; I would like to find some new ones to check out.</p>
<p>On the painting side of things I have been trying a few new things. Last week I started a portrait of J. If it improves I will post it here &#8211; but how it stands now I am not that happy with it. I used to do quite a bit of life drawing and painting from the model in my undergrad studies but have not in the last long while. It makes me realize how drawing or painting from life is a skill the requires  continued practice.</p>

From the <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20060220.ANSELM20/TPStory/Entertainment">review </a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The artist&#8217;s work is thus understood as creating the bridge between two realms through the very palpable and earthly medium of paint &#8212; soil impregnated with pigment and oil. It&#8217;s our cue to understand Kiefer&#8217;s attachment to the landscape, and more particularly, the scoured and plowed field, as a recurring subject in his art. The field is humble matter &#8212; paint, mud, the rotted remains of the past &#8212; from which we reach and strive.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am looking forward to seeing it. Has anyone already been? What do you think of his work?</p>

The search engine has agreed to the Chineses government&#8217;s cencorship policies. The irony is that I found many Google ads on <a href="http://tech.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1097479.php/Tibetan_website_closes_for_a_day_to_protest_Google_censorship">pages </a>covering the call to boycott.  Not only that but I even found stories regarding this using the Google News search tool (I wanted to know if they were self censuring). I think I will change my homepage on my browser to another page &#8211; it used to be Google Canada&#8217;s site.</p>
<blockquote><p>Typing â€œDalai Lamaâ€ into Google&#8217;s U.S. Web site yields dozens of pages of results on the 14th Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of Tibet. Top results include his Web site, his biography and news of his appearances around the world.</p>
<p>The same search using Google.cn yields none of those sites. Instead, Chinese users get headlines such as â€œDalai Lama unpopular among Tibetans: chairman of Tibet,â€ and â€œDalai Lama Aims to Split Motherland.â€<br />

<p><img class="lazy" data-src="/images/vote_canada.gif" alt="Canada vote, popular vote compared to seat distribution" /></p>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Canadian Ballot recipes</h3><p>2006-01-23</p><p><p>Today is election day in Canada and most people I talk to are quite nervous of the out come. If polls are correct (they often are not) then we will be waking up to a conservative government tomorrow morning. On this note, I think that we should be able to spoil our ballots and have them counted. This would allow people to express themselves in a positive way (instead of not voting because there are no acceptable options). The percentage of spoiled  or &#8216;none of the above&#8217; ballots should then be released with the official results of each riding. </p>
<p>I am not referring to the <a href="http://edibleballot.tao.ca">eat your ballot</a> option. An interesting option but it may cause strange digestive problems &#8211; just think of all that black ink. </p>
<p>In Canada it is actually illegal to spoil your ballot (I assume that eating it is also illegal).</p>
<blockquote><p>According to section 167(2)(a) of the Canada Elections Act, &#8220;no person shall wilfully alter, deface or destroy a ballot.&#8221; Subsection 480(1) of the Act also provides that every person is guilty of an offence who, with the intention of delaying or obstructing the electoral process, contravenes this Act.</p></blockquote>

On saturday we roamed around manhattan with no real plan. We happened upon <a href="http://www.deitch.com/projects/project_images.php?slideShowId=244&#038;projId=171">The Deitch Project first annual Art Parade</a> in SOHO in the afternoon. It was a fun, goofy, crazy event.  Perhaps Montreal is in need of something like this. </p>
<p>Update : found <a href="http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/people/laster/laster9-14-05.asp">this link</a> for more photos of the parade.</p>
<p><img class="lazy" data-src="/images/r_wolfe.jpg" alt="Ryan Wolfe" align="left" style="margin-right: 5px;"  />On Sunday we walked around Williamsburg area and saw quite a few galleries.  One highlight was the <a href="http://blackandwhiteartgallery.com/">Black and White Gallery</a>.  The gallery has a great courtyard which had a very nice photo installed on the back wall (see right photo). </p>
<p>Another interesting show was at <a href="http://www.damstuhltrager.com">Dam Stuhltrager</a>.  Ryan Wolfe&#8217;s computerised grass blowing in the wind was simple and beautiful. It did, however, remind me a lot of sculpture done by the artist <a href="http://collections.ic.gc.ca/mercer/273.html">Doug Buis</a>. Novelty is over-rated anyhow. (see left photo)</p>

<p>Justin Laku founder of Canadian Friends of Sudan recently paid a four-day visit to three refugee camps outside of El Fasher, the capital of North Darfur.</p>
<blockquote><p>&#8220;In comparison, the condition of a Canadian zoo is 10 times better,&#8221; Ottawa resident Laku said of the camps. &#8220;There is no water, no sanitation, no toilets, nothing whatsoever.&#8221;<br />

<p>The Bush administration still shares intelligence with the Sudan government even after it has stated that they have been commiting genocide. Their reasoning is that is neccessary in the &#8216;war on terror&#8217;. What else are they going to justify with this so called war?</p>
<blockquote><p>The Bush administration described the Darfur atrocities as genocide in order to please the Christian right ahead of the American presidential elections, according to a senior US official.<br />

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>referendums are stupid</h3><p>2005-06-16</p><p><p>A friend forwarded me an email to vote online for the &#8220;<a href="http://www.referendumcanada.ca/uficanada/referendum/">The National Marriage Referendum : Should Parliament pass Bill C-38 to legalize same-sex marriage in Canada?</a>&#8220;. </p>
<p>After visiting the site and seeing the Yes votes out voted by the No votes my immedaite reaction was to vote Yes and forward the site link to as many like minded people I know. But I am undecided if I am going to vote as I believe that questions of such matter should not be decided with a referendum. The rights of a minority should never be decided by the majority. Even more, if a right is protected by <a href="http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/charter/">The Charter</a>, then it is guaranteed, no matter what the out come of a referendum. </p>
<p>The logic of a referendum is such that the majority can deny or take away the rights of a minority. I hope the Liberals do not bow to the Conservatives pressure to <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20050616.wbudge0616/BNStory/National/">delay the vote</a> on gay marriage.  Have a back bone and stand up for what you believe in.</p>
<p>I am undecided. I want to see the Yes votes increase but I do not agree with the principle of a referendum.</p>
<p>Note : the site that is organising this online referendum is &#8220;the Defend Marriage Project of United Families Canada.&#8221;</p>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Sustaining Abstract Painting</h3><p>2005-06-10</p><p><p>I like these few sentences from Donald Kuspit&#8217;s review of Wlodzimierz Ksiazek&#8217;s abstract paintings. I was unfamiliar with Ksiazek&#8217;s work and  am now intrigued by the physicality of his  paintings. I have always thought that one of painting&#8217;s great capacities is its ability to both illustrate and at the same time be a very physical medium. I like this duality and play with it in my paintings.</p>
<blockquote><p>I am suggesting that from the start Ksiazek realized that two-dimensionality and three-dimensionality are inseparable &#8212; one always implies the other &#8212; and that the priority that modernist painting gave to flat painting, by reason of its &#8220;critical&#8221; relationship to the flatness of the canvas, is a reductive premise and falsifying limitation of painting, that is, an inhibiting and peculiarly naive &#8220;formalism.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>The reason that art in the postmodern, existential world has reached something of a culdesac is not that art itself is exhausted, but that the existential worldview is.  Just as rational modernity previously exhausted its forms and gave way to aperspectival postmodernity, so now the postmodern itself is on a morbid death watch, with nothing but infinitely mirrored irony to hold its hand, casting flowers where they will not be missed.  The skull of postmodernity grins on the near horizon, and in the meantime, we are between two worldviews, one slowly dying, one not yet born.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Of course, most of us probably didn&#8217;t recognize that we were latecomers to the grad-school pyramid scheme. Theory with a capital T grew up with the expansion of graduate programs and the adjunctification of higer education during the last 30 years. It was a ticket to success for a charmed circle of insiders: a few people at elite institutions with the connections and advance knowledge to get in and out of the game before the general rush. The language of theory &#8211; carefully deployed in the world of academic hiring and publication &#8211; still functions in ways that suggest the sub rosa communications of Ivy League clubmen in the world of investment banking.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p>Beck&#8217;s Futures, I have come to realise, is a satire on the emptiness of prizes and the idiocy of art.</p></blockquote>
<p>Christina Mackie has won the Beck&#8217;s Futures Art Award (London). I am writing about this for a few reasons. One is the amount of money it comes with &#8211; $63 275.00 (in Canadian dollars), which is fairly substantial. The Canada Council reserves this type of support to senior artists. Another is that it seems she grew up in Canada (for some reason most of the articles mention this). And there is this scathing article thatnot only slams her art work but also the premise of the prize.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mackie&#8217;s work would not make you look twice in a mediocre group show.</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>It seems that the sillier art becomes, the more money gets thrown into its void. You know, some people actually do create works of art that are engaging, complex, and multi-layered.</p></blockquote>
<p>I cannot remember the general tone of Jonathan Jones&#8217; previous reviews and/or articles but it makes me want to pay attention to his further writings. Not because he is somewhat vicious but because it seeme that he is not afraid to express ideas that could be interpreted as anti-intellectual or anti-avant-garde.</p>

<p>j and i went to the adirondack mountains this weekend. it was fabulous. the weather was great and the camping and hiking area even better. the above photo was taken from the top of mount jo. i didn&#8217;t bring a camera and found the photo on the web <a href="http://www.union.edu/PUBLIC/GEODEPT/COURSES/petrology/fieldtrips/fieldtrips2002.htm">here</a> after doing a <a href="http://images.google.ca/images?hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;q=mount+jo+">google search</a>. we spent a long time lying in the sun and looking at this view. i searched for a picture of the view from our campsite on heart lake (the lake in the lower part of the picture) but have not found one yet.  interesting that there are certain places in the world that have been captured in pictures by many people. of course the view was quite different yesterday but the picture is surprisingly similar (there were no leaves on the trees and a bit of snow at higher elevations). the sky was different though and there was a bit of ice still on the northern edge of the lake. i prefer my mental image.</p>

<blockquote><p>The 31 paintings in Damien Hirst&#8217;s sad new show at Gagosian are not paintings at all; or rather, they&#8217;re generic-to-bad photo-realist efforts. Any semi-adept student or average commercial artist could have made them. Many do. But this isn&#8217;t what makes Hirst&#8217;s paintings sad; it only makes them ordinary and academic.<br />
from <a href="http://www.artnet.com/Magazine//features/jsaltz/saltz4-6-05.asp">The Emperor&#8217;s New Paintings by Jerry Saltz</a></p></blockquote>
<p>it is not the avant garde aspect of his work that annoys me but the simplistic shock reaction that he seems to searh for. it is easy to shock and it is a one-liner. what is even worse is the art world&#8217;s taking of his work hook, line and sinker. not only is his work praised in many art theory books but his work sells very well. the works in this show go for between a quarter million and two million. not bad work if you can get it. why don&#8217;t these art collectors (speculators) look a bit more at less blue chip artist? spread the interest and wealth a bit. </p>
<blockquote><p>Seeing Hirst rehash his old subjects in such pale ways is like listening to Paul McCartney sing Beatles songs in Wings.</p></blockquote>

There is an interesting article on the work (and the person) of Cy Twombly. I have never really had a decisive viewpoint on what I think of his work but I have always been intrigued by it. I think more and more. His gestural marks (that some people call doodles) are very immediate and casual. At the same time they are quite serious and create a situation of pause and reflection.  Randomness has interested me for quite some time. I do not refer to randomness in the sense of putting down whatever but more of a state where the discursive mind is less present. Perhaps openness is a better term. My work usually swings from randomness (gestural) to more contrived editing. </p>
<blockquote><p>Nobody, however, could erect a theory on Twombly&#8217;s images. They are not just products of the imagination; they do not exist as correlatives to ideas, let alone to things. Done in pencil and crayon, Twombly&#8217;s trademark images capture the transient, universal sign of distraction: the doodle.</p></blockquote>

i deliberated if i should post this drawing. i am not sure what i think of it &#8211; whether is good or what it suggests. the reason for this blog however, is to post things from my sketchbook and not to edit too much. many of the things i put down on paper are not very interesting (ideas or drawings) but it is helpful to put them down. often i find it cathartic to get rid of the forms that i think of in my head. if i don&#8217;t draw them they remain there and take up space and sometimes cause stress. so here it is, an unedited look. <br clear="all"></p>

There is no good work of art that cannot be described in intelligible English, however long it might take, however much patience is required. And yet this book begins with four theoretical essays explaining the post-structuralist concepts the authors believe we need before we can meaningfully discuss a single work of art.</p></blockquote>
<p>I came across this article (<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/arts/features/story/0,11710,1443874,00.html">Lost in a labyrinth of theory</a>)  via another art blog (<a href="http://www.artsjournal.com/man/">Modern Art Notes</a>).  It is true that I am often annoyed with the extent or importance that is put on theory in the art world. Often it seems as if the theory is not there to describe or investigate the art but that the art is there to elucidate the theory. At the same time a certain amount of specialized language is required. </p>

<p>i have been planning on continuing with my landscape series in the near future. this drawing, or painting on paper, was done quite a while ago but i do like the fog effect. most of the landscapes that i have made are either fictional places (made up from my imagination) or conjured up from my memory. often the landscapes of the ocean are places that i have been and miss. i have started thinking of several new paintings along these lines and may post some of the sketches soon.</p>

Digital image</p>
<p>it is not very often that i create images digitally but this is an example. at times i work through various possibilities digitally but usually i do so in the studio or in my sketchbook. but as this blog has become somewhat of a working sketchbook, i think there are ways to experiment with imagery, colour, etc. using the computer. even if i come up with interesting ideas in this way i feel that the true test is how it will look when made into a &#8216;real&#8217; painting. it is hard to ignore, especially for me, paint&#8217;s physical quality. i have wrote these thoughts before and perhaps it is me making excuses for spending time on these digital, or web-based, images. this being said, i think that this &#8216;sketch&#8217; (there are  the quotation marks again) could make for an interesting avenue to explore on canvas.</p>

: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So, what is left to find in painting? Quite frankly, in the context of Postmodernism,<br />
    rather too much. While the constant refinement of Modernist abstraction is<br />
    now an old story, the pluralism that so happily succeeded it seems increasingly<br />
    unmoored. The freedom of Postmodern painters is in the advocacy of their caprices.<br />
    In other words, they get to paint whatever they want however the hell they<br />
    want, and don&#8217;t mind us, we&#8217;ll find a way to stomach it somehow. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was surprised and glad to read this review of a show on ArtNet.com. Has the<br />
&#8216;freedom of Postmodern painters&#8217; caused them to become more unmoored than Modernist<br />
painters at the turn of the century supposedly did? I am not sure. The pluralism of so called<br />
Postmodern painters obviously irks this reviewer. It makes me wonder if he would<br />
express similar sentiments if he were reviewing a show of &#8216;Modernist&#8217; painting<br />
as painters diverged from figurative work.</p>

I was thinking of what it means to view images of art work posted on web sites in lieu of experiencing them in person. On Chris Ashley&#8217;s site he has an article someone wrote about his &#8216;paintings&#8217; that I found interesting.</p>
<blockquote><p>Chris Ashley is a painter. That’s the first thing I want to say, and as it may turn out, the most radical, because he creates his color images without paint. Ashley uses HTML (hypertext markup language), the original and rudimentary instructional software of the internet, and delivers the results to his audience via the web. No brushes to clean. No walls to leave nail holes in. His studio/gallery is, in the parlance, a Blog, an online journal he maintains on a day to day basis.<br /><a href="http://www.chrisashley.net/weblog/archives/week_2004_10_10.html#000494" target="new">George Lawson: Chris Ashley’s HTML Drawings</a></p></blockquote>
<p>I have always found that the physical aspect of my paintings to be very important (as most or all paintings). At the same time my paintings have been experienced only by seeing images on a screen. In fact I have sold paintings based on people viewing images on my web site. Perhaps the &#8216;flattening&#8217; of painting on the web happens with many other areas as well (journalism, literature, etc.).</p>
<blockquote><p>There are philosophical implications to the virtual reality, the non-physical aspect of these HTML images. Rather than painting, one might call them coding, and one could ask angel-on-a-pinhead questions like, “What direction is the light coming from?” and, “How big are they?” They don’t conform to painting’s standard vocabulary, deriving their color as they do neither from mass tone nor undertone. </p></blockquote>

<p>i am getting quite a bit behind in the studio lately. ideas have been piling up in my head for new paintings and i have not been to the studio to get them down in a more concrete form. this creates the dilemma of whether to make time to get there (the studio) or get those slides and other information off to the gallery. time seems like a delicious commodity lately.</p>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>The End of Suburbia (I wish)</h3><p>2004-12-20</p><p><p>I came accross a link to this documentary on another blog (I can&#8217;t remember which). It looks very interesting. It investigates the problematics of suburbia &#8211; a topic that I have had an interest for some time. I think that this type of (sub)urban planning creates dead communities. Vast areas of asphalt and manicured lawns where everyone drives around in cars. Have you ever walked through a suburb? You seem very out of place as a pedestrian &#8211; chances are, you are the only one walking. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.endofsuburbia.com/">THE END OF SUBURBIA: Oil Depletion and the Collapse of The American Dream</a></p>
<blockquote><p>But as we enter the 21st century, serious questions are beginning to emerge about the sustainability of this way of life. With brutal honesty and a touch of irony, The End of Suburbia explores the American Way of Life and its prospects as the planet approaches a critical era, as global demand for fossil fuels begins to outstrip supply. World Oil Peak and the inevitable decline of fossil fuels are upon us now, some scientists and policy makers argue in this documentary.</p></blockquote>

<p>i took this drawing out to show someone at the studio the other week. it is interesting to look at your work from a distance of many years. it is almost as if it has been made by someone else. at the same time i can see marks and remember making them &#8211; or remember what i was doing (that day, week) when i made it. for this drawing, i can picture what time of day i made it and bright sunny light in my studio.</p>
</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Keeping Art Dangerous</h3><p>2004-12-13</p><p><p>If you spend any time walking around the Mile-End or Plateau region of Montreal you have surely seen some of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/zekesgallery/sets/13388/show/" target="new">Roadworth&#8217;s stencil art</a>. Apparently he was busted and charged with 85 counts of public mischief. </p>
<p>Zeke, of Zeke&#8217;s Gallery has started a (email) <a href="http://zekesgallery.blogspot.com/2004/12/free-roadsworth.html" target="new">campaign</a> to have  his interventions considered art and not common vandalism. It is an interesting debate &#8211; when does something become art and when is it graffiti? At the same time, part of what makes his art works interesting is that they <b>are</b> illegal and have to be made in a very covert way. The illegality of the work removes it from the institution of art (i.e. galleries or sanctioned art venue). I do not want him to get punished too harshly but at the same time I feel that having the city or the police sanction his interventions as Art will, for me, lessen the work. A large part of the impact is that it is rebellious, unsanctioned and clandestine. </p>
<p>I really like his stencils and find that they are often very clever. It is nice when art interjects itself into common, pedestrian venues. There is an especially clever stencil on Fairmount, just east of St Laurent &#8211; a vine wraps around the shadow of a lampost (cast from a street light).</p>
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="http://www.montrealmirror.com/2004/120904/front.html" target="new">Montreal Mirror</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The zipper on Parc above the interchange, the light switch on St-Laurent and St-Viateur, the vines at St-Urbain and St-Joseph; these are some of the unique signature pieces by Montreal stencil artist sensation Roadsworth. While widely praised for bringing some life onto Montreal&#8217;s otherwise drab and potholed Plateau streets, Roadsworth&#8217;s popularity didn&#8217;t save him from being arrested last week by Montreal police.</p></blockquote>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Open Letter to a Bike Thief</h3><p>2004-11-24</p><p><p>Ok, this is not an open letter to just any bike thief. It is, rather, an open letter to the bike thief who stole my bike this morning. The bike thief that stole my bike a little over a year ago may also consider this addressed to him or her (although I suspect it is a him).</p>
<p>First of all, fuck you. I used that bike for my main mode of transportation. It was not a luxurious toy.  When I saw my crumpled bike lock where my bike used to be this morning, I was on my way to work. Thanks to you I was late. </p>
<p>I think there are levels of thieves and you my friend are near the bottom. You remind me of horse thieves and how they were considered to exist on the lowest level of thief-dom. You should be punished not only for the value in dollars that you steal but for the fact that you are stealing someones mode of transportation. Car thieves get their own category don&#8217;t they? Why not you as well? Perhaps you should have to work in a bike shop for free. Or volunteer for an alternative transportation group like Critical Mass.</p>
<p>So tell me, how much did you get for it? Was it worth it? Did you buy crack? A 40 ouncer? It would make me feel better if you bought some new shoes  for your kid but somehow I think that your motive was less noble. </p>
<p>P.S. &#8211; fuck you.</p>

It is suprising that this type of swaying is allowed on the day of election. Shouldn&#8217;t there be a free and unhindered atmosphere at the polling stations? </p>
<p>From <a href="http://www.truthout.org/docs_04/103104A.shtml" target="new">Truth Out</a> :</p>
<blockquote><p>With political analysts agreeing that voter turnout, especially of minority and youth voters, will likely determine the outcome of next Tuesday&#8217;s presidential election, civil and human rights groups are pressing the Republican National Committee (RNC) to call off plans aimed at discouraging people from casting ballots.</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the US version of democracy should be fixed before it is spread around the world. From <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/metro/20041031-115519-8720r.htm" target="new">The Washington Post</a> :</p>
<blockquote><p>Precincts in Virginia and Maryland will allow international observers to monitor the election process tomorrow, despite concerns from local voters who say such a presence undermines U.S. sovereignty.</p></blockquote>
<p>Michael Moore is asking people to document cases of election fraud with their video cameras. This <a href="http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/index.php?id=274" target="new">article</a> was also published in The Guardian :</p>
<blockquote><p>The filmmaker Michael Moore has announced a large-scale effort to combat dirty tricks during tomorrow&#8217;s US election by stationing hundreds of people with video cameras outside polling stations.</p></blockquote>

If we look at it in world terms, we are in fact mostly filthy rich ourselves. Figures from the World Bank indicate this: <b>If you make $25,000 a year, you&#8217;re in the top 10 per cent of wage earners on the face of the Earth.</b></p></blockquote>
<p>It is taken from an <a href="http://www.rabble.ca/news_full_story.shtml?sh_itm=c10725c8fdcf1aaa387615b62ba520c2&#038;r=1" target="new">article</a> that features the result of a study on the happiness of Canadians.

<p>The idea for this blog started as a place to post images from my sketchbook. While it has remained this to a large extent, it expanded in scope as well. I also have been posting images of works in progress from time to time. From this I have developed a method of working where I work on images of unfinished paintings in Photoshop before continuing with them in the studio. Furthermore, I am also posting a fair amount of material in the Politics and Ideas section. These are mostly articles that I come accross in my reading of numerous web sites. And lastly I also post things from my trips or general life in the Day to Day section.</p>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Bush and the NY Times</h3><p>2004-10-19</p><p><p><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/magazine/17BUSH.html">Here</a> is an informative article that was printed in the NY Times a few days ago. The newspaper has openly declared their supprot for Kerry in the upcoming election (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/opinion/17sun1.html?ex=1255752000&#38;en=29df467441c52478&#38;ei=5088&#38;partner=rssnyt">John Kerry for President</a>). To view these articles you will need to sign up (for free). This is an anecdote from the first mentioned story:</p>
<blockquote><p>There is one story about Bush&#8217;s particular brand of certainty I am able to piece together and tell for the record.</p>
<p>In the Oval Office in December 2002, the president met with a few ranking senators and members of the House, both Republicans and Democrats. In those days, there were high hopes that the United States-sponsored &#8221;road map&#8221; for the Israelis and Palestinians would be a pathway to peace, and the discussion that wintry day was, in part, about countries providing peacekeeping forces in the region. The problem, everyone agreed, was that a number of European countries, like France and Germany, had armies that were not trusted by either the Israelis or Palestinians. One congressman &#8212; the Hungarian-born Tom Lantos, a Democrat from California and the only Holocaust survivor in Congress &#8212; mentioned that the Scandinavian countries were viewed more positively. Lantos went on to describe for the president how the Swedish Army might be an ideal candidate to anchor a small peacekeeping force on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Sweden has a well-trained force of about 25,000. The president looked at him appraisingly, several people in the room recall.</p>
<p>&#8221;I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re talking about Sweden,&#8221; Bush said. &#8221;They&#8217;re the neutral one. They don&#8217;t have an army.&#8221;</p>
<p>Lantos paused, a little shocked, and offered a gentlemanly reply: &#8221;Mr. President, you may have thought that I said Switzerland. They&#8217;re the ones that are historically neutral, without an army.&#8221; Then Lantos mentioned, in a gracious aside, that the Swiss do have a tough national guard to protect the country in the event of invasion.</p>
<p>Bush held to his view. &#8221;No, no, it&#8217;s Sweden that has no army.&#8221;</p>
<p>The room went silent, until someone changed the subject.</p>
<p>A few weeks later, members of Congress and their spouses gathered with administration officials and other dignitaries for the White House Christmas party. The president saw Lantos and grabbed him by the shoulder. &#8221;You were right,&#8221; he said, with bonhomie. &#8221;Sweden does have an army.&#8221; </p></blockquote>

i finally finished this painting this afternoon. i struggled a bit with the colour of the dots but i have decided to stick with this hue of pink. <a href="/images/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/on_paper/blue_pink.html">here</a> is a previous post where i was working with the colour using photoshop. the slight yelloe hue added to the pink makes the pink contrast with the blue-grey of the &#8216;background&#8217; a bit better. i withheld from making this painting overly complicated as i feel that it&#8217;s simplicity makes its stronger. there is another painting in this series (that i may post later) that i completely over-worked and am now trying to salvage. although it may be at the point of no return so i will over-work it to death in hopes of something interesting happening in doing so.</p>

<br />
i seem to drift between the micro and the macro and not rest in between. what i remember most about visiting places are the close ups of streets, rock, sand, skin. i am still able to see the texture of the streets of madrid, the colour of the rock while climbing in welsford, the cracked plaster over the bed in my old apartment. i can picture the constellation on your back. or the far-reaching vistas, horizon line, mountain contours, cloud formations. the in between views fade away more quickly as if stored in a temporary place to be replaced rugularily.</p>

The issue is quite good with an article on Iraq by Klein and a long feature by Lampham about how the Right in the U.S. effectively bought their power and influence.</p>
<p>Klein&#8217;s article :</p>
<blockquote><p>Every policy that liberates multinational corporations to pursue their quest for profit would be put into place: a shrunken  state, a flexible workforce, open borders, minimal taxes, no tariffs, no ownership restrictions. The people of Iraq would,  of course, have to endure some short-term pain: assets, previously owned by the state, would have to be given up to create  new opportunities for growth and investment.<br />

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Pomo</h3><p>2004-09-21</p><p><p>From a NY Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/20/arts/20gard.html?ex=1253419200&#038;en=68cde14bec4c9ca3&#038;ei=5088&#038;partner=rssnyt">Article</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Many say that no real avant-garde &#8211; which I&#8217;ll define as a combative group of free-thinking artists &#8211; can exist anymore. The media&#8217;s reach is too vast. New artists and movements get snatched up too quickly. If they are popular they get overexposed and stale. If they are not popular they disappear, and the marketeers decide they had better play it safe next time.</p></blockquote>
<p>I wonder how this media effect works on the idea of artist becoming successful in their life time. Is the idea that an artist is more likely to become known after they are dead, dead? Perhaps the spread of media has caused our cultural history memory to be shortened &#8211; we remember less but are aware of current art more.</p>
<blockquote><p>Universities are filled with arts programs. The training raises the level of craft and sophistication. It does not necessarily raise the courage quotient &#8211; the likelihood that artists will go their own way despite the rules dictated by the vanguard. &#8230; Postmodernism has the same effect. It drives artists to mine the past constantly &#8211; and flagrantly. </p></blockquote>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>The Democracy Paintings</h3><p>2004-09-17</p><p><p>I have been thinking about a new project called The Democracy Project or The Democracy Paintings. It will be a way to truly combine internet media and painting. I am not sure that my painting would benefit from this &#8216;merger&#8217; but anyhow, here is the idea.</p>
<p>There are times that I post works in progress on my <a href="http://www.markdixon.ca">art web site</a> (<a href="http://www.markdixon.ca">portfolio</a>) even though it is not as regular as I had intitially anticipated or wanted. My idea is to continue with  this in a more regular manner. I will start a series of paintings and then photograph them. For each painting I will work out several (maybe 3) different avenues using PhotoShop. Readers (i.e. people like you) will then vote on which avenue they want the painting to continue in. This will be repeated until the &#8216;voters&#8217; decide that the painting is finished. I did something like this <a href="/images/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/on_paper/study_painting.html">here</a>. </p>
<p>There is something I really like about taking aesthetic judgement away from myself and letting it rest with the majority. It is true that it will not rest entirely with the voters as they will be presented with limited choices but it  could be an interesting exercise. One problem I can foresee (besides no one voting) is that besides <a href="/images/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/on_paper/study_painting.html">this</a> painting, I have never really worked out a painting using digital means. </p>
<p>Stay tuned.</p>

This is one of the studies for <a href="/images/users/mark/LargePaintings/pt_lg_01.jpg" target="new">this</a> painting. The form in the lower part of the canvas started out as a linear form but ended up as a flat area of colour (applied thicky using tape to block out the shapre).</p>

Took this picture on a beach just up river from Baie Saint-Paul this weekend. (Just realised that the photo&#8217;s composition is similar to the one I took in New River Beach (below)). It is a beautiful area. The trip made me want to spend more time in the Charlevoix region. We stayed at a great place in a little cabin.</p>

<p>Linda McQuaig writes on <a href="http://www.rabble.ca/columnists_full.shtml?x=33785" target="new">rabble.ca</a></p>
<blockquote><p>It&#8217;s downright strange that the U.S. presidential election campaign — easily the most important in decades — has come to focus on what happened in a faraway boat during the course of a few minutes more than 30 years ago.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rick Salutin (who also writes for The Globe and Mail) writes about losing, the Olympics and the nature of communities. Also on <a href="http://www.rabble.ca/columnists_full.shtml?x=33762" target="new">rabble.ca</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Many countries have unifying elements like ethnicity, religion or language. When these are lacking or sparse, as in Canada, that need to belong is so strong that people find a way to identify anyhow, with what have been called “imagined communities,” which also makes sense to me. I&#8217;d add that nations are not just communities (like churches, unions, clubs etc.) but have a political nature.</p></blockquote>

It occured to me that the size of these drawings may be a bit of a mystery. Most are around 8.5 x 11 (like this one) &#8211; the size of a page from a medium sized sketchbook. Others are cropped (like yesterday&#8217;s), and thus are smaller.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that this Fall is going to be a very productive time in the studio. For now I am struggling to get anything done (with life and summer monopolising my time).</p>

An example of a drawing done in my sketchbook that does not usually see the light of day. Often I draw these type of fictions and they never develop into paintings or larger drawings. Perhaps I am too attached to the idea of working in series and should make more diverent (thematically) work.</p>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Hotel Art</h3><p>2004-08-24</p><p><p>It is always nice to see interesting, current art exhibited outside of galleries and museums. There are times that these attempts do not work very well but mostly, I think, it is a good tendency. Several hotels have been showing contemporary artists in their lobbies and rooms. The is an article in <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20040823/HOTEL23/TPEntertainment/TopStories" target="new">The Globe and Mail</a> about this. How nice that we are spared looking at the typical cheesy reproductions at these hotels.</p>
<blockquote><p>Hotel art, once the mainstay of washed-out reproduced masterpieces and the butt of bad jokes, has recently acquired a bold new lease on life. Forget the Frette linens, celebrity chefs and Aveda bath products. To stay on top of the game, luxury high-end chains and boutique hotels must now provide their guests with cultural stimulation too, which is why a growing number of hoteliers in Canada and around the world are investing in serious modern-art collections to spice up their designer lobbies.</p></blockquote>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>From an Older Sketchbook</h3><p>2004-08-20</p><p><p><img class="lazy" data-src="/images/blosxom/old_1_sm.jpg"><br />
I have scanned a few pages from my previous sketchbook and will post a few here. These drawings were done in the last year or so. It is interesting to go back after a good length of time and look at things one has done. After a certain point the work almost seems like it has been made by someone else. Although I am surprised at how much I remember about the making of a painting. The other week I was moving a few large paintings (that I made around 1994!)that are in storage at my father&#8217;s place. I actually remembered working on certain areas of the painting, choosing colours, etc.</p>
<p>Distance (time) allows one to edit a bit more accurately. This is why I do not like showing work that has only recently been finished. Although it always seems to happen that I am vigourously trying to finish a few paintings before the show starts &#8230;</p>

These forms in my sketchbook are starting to seem like characters to me. They do not appear together but seperate on the page. Perhaps some of them should be put together (pastiche) in the the composition.</p>
</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Float</h3><p>2004-08-18</p><p><p><img class="lazy" data-src="/images/blosxom/float.jpg"><br />
My sketchbook has not seen a lot of action lately and thus my choices as to what I post has been limited. Here is a a quick drawing of a form that I pictured recently.</p>
</p></div><div class='post'><h3>From Chads to Worse</h3><p>2004-08-16</p><p><p>The US, the champion of democracy, will get election observers for the coming election.</p>
<blockquote><p>An effort by more than a dozen Democratic lawmakers to bring international observers to monitor the November elections has paid off with an invitation by the State Department to the Vienna-based Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). <a href="http://us.oneworld.net/article/view/91622/1/" target="new">One World United States</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In another related article on rabble.ca, Linda MaQuaig writes about the potential for more election problems in Florida. The plan to use electronic voting machines will make it impossible to do recounts. Given that the the results could be so close this requirement is a true possibility.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of course, no country likes to admit that its elections need U.N. supervision. But the allegations of black disenfranchisement are so serious and the election so potentially close that the involvement of a neutral body, unconnected to the Bush family, might be useful. </p>
<p>If the Florida voting is as close as expected, recounts will be inevitable — but impossible. <a href="http://www.rabble.ca/columnists_full.shtml?x=33471" target="new">View article</a>

<p>The above fact has not gone unnoticed in Bush&#8217;s Whitehouse to the south. As the<br />
U.S. consumes more and more oil it must look for more reserves. Relying on imports<br />
of oil<br />
from the Middle East has obvious problems (Iraq). There is no doubt that the<br />
U.S.&#8217;s foreign policy is influenced by its oil policy. Given this, what would<br />
this mean to Canada to be supplying a great quantity of oil to our southern neighbours?</p>

<p>This is where I was last week. It was hard to come into work this morning after spending a week by the lake and ocean. This picture is from a short hike I did with my nephews at New River Beach in NB. It was a great day &#8211; beautiful weather.</p>

Am now at a internet cafe around the corner as I have not yet got access at home. Perhaps I will wait and see and not get it &#8211; although my roomate would not be impressed.

The colour combination of this drawing came to me as I was walking home one day. Perhaps something I saw sparked the idea. I remember seeing vividly how it would look. I was not that happy with the result of this drawing. Perhaps it would work better as a large painting &#8211; with the orange &#8216;background&#8217; being somewhat translucent and textured. The above drawing is done with coloured pastels and is about 30 x 26 inches.</p>

Ok, so it is not the most recent drawing (it was done last March). I haven&#8217;t been scanning many pages from my sketchbook lately but I plan to do so soon. I have been busy with many of life&#8217;s distractions lately.</p>
</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Divergent Ideas</h3><p>2004-07-22</p><p><p><img class="lazy" data-src="/images/blosxom/draw_24_march_sm.jpg"><br />
There is not that much that is special about this drawing but I feel like putting up the bad with the good with this project. Often I have the problem of too many diverging ideas for paintings and not enough time (and materials) to start them.</p>
</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Save the Waves</h3><p>2004-07-22</p><p><p>I went to see Jean-Pierre Aubé&#8217;s Save the Waves exhibit at <a href="http://www.quartierephemere.org/fonderie/" target="new">La Fondarie Darling</a> today. It is a sculptural installation that &#8216;captures&#8217; and then plays electrical waves. Here is a better and more detailed description :</p>
<blockquote><p>Summer long, the huge transformer of Hydro Québec, next to the Fonderie Darling, will be under close monitoring. The transformer generates a 60 cycle per second humm, the offical wavelength of the american power grid. This is the sound of electricity, the contemporary soundtrack of our domestic life. It will be captured by 8 VLF antennas implanted in the old Fonderie. <br /><a href="http://www.kloud.org/vlf_soundsystem.html" target="new">www.kloud.org</a>
</p></blockquote>
<p>Even though the installation is comprised of large speakers, I found it to be a interesting sculpture to look at. The speakers are made of wood and have an organic feel to them. The main aspect of the work however is the sound element. The space (large and empty) is filled with the humming and droning of the waves the contraption is &#8216;catching&#8217;. At first it seems as though the sound of the waves&#8217; are regular but closer observation reveals that there are slight fluctuations. What I enjoyed most was the harmonics that are created with the overlapping of the deep bass tones (waves) with higher pitched ones. It reminded me of Tibetan throat singing. It was a nice thing to do during my lunch break. I think I should stop by La Fondarie more often, especially given that I work next door.</p>

<p>Often I am intrigued by scientific images that I come accross. It is not very often, however, that these images make their way into the paintings or drawings directly. At times parts of the image or diagram does, however, make it into a painting or inspire it in some way. Sometimes it is a combination of colours other times a forms shape. In this blue image (on the right) I am interested in the space it creates and the possibility it could serve as background or starting point for a new painting. Perhaps someday I will reproduce an image I have found.</p>

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Farenheit 9/11</h3><p>2004-07-13</p><p><p>Last week I went to see Michael Moore&#8217;s latest movie. It was interesting to see it after all the news and controversy about it. I enjoyed watching it even though there was not a lot of things that I learned in it. It helps as well that I agree roughly with his politics.</p>
<p>There were times, however, that I found it a bit annoying. It definitely is not a documentary but a commentary piece. His methods are not very sophisticated and he often relies on emotional justaposition of elements to stir his audience. For example he cuts from one series of shots (Bush giving his invasion of Iraq) to another (kids playing in Bagdad). He also uses music in an emotive (and humerous) way as well. I found it a bit surprising that when he was making fun of the supposed &#8220;Coalition of the Willing&#8221; that he fails to mention Britain and Australia. It ends up discrediting the film.</p>
<p>It is worth seeing and I wonder what impact it will have in the Fall election</p>

It is a short drive from Montreal (about and hour and a half) and just south of Burlington. It was a beautiful day for hiking &#8211; clear skies and a cool breeze. We got rained on just before reaching the car though. That was ok, as it made the food and beer had in Burlington taste that much better. It is a great little town. I think, that if I were to live anywhere in the US it would be Vermont.</p>

The Court determined that the prisoners cannot be held in a prison beyond the law, and are entitled to basic legal rights.

<blockquote><p>
It is a privilege not to be hated for your nationality, and we should not relinquish it lightly. George Bush has denied that privilege to his own people, and Stephen Harper would cavalierly strip it from Canadians by erasing what few small but important differences remain between Canadian and U.S. foreign policy. The danger posed by this act is not just about whether Canadians are safe when we travel to the Middle East. The hatred that Bush is manufacturing there, for the United States and its coalition partners, is already following the soldiers home.

  at work &#8211; perhaps because I think it will become more of a habit. I was thinking<br />
  that it would make me become more diligent about putting my ideas into my sketchbook.</p>
<p>I have a few more ideas for new paintings and perhaps they will show up soon<br />

It it posted on the Zmag.org site.</p>
<blockquote><p>This goes back to what should be causing extreme alarm. If there are political programs on TV, yet it takes an artist to actually energize political debate, that tells you something really quite frightening about the level of the political debate happening on mainstream channels-right-wing-biased mothers. One of the interesting things here is that the people who should be shaping the future are politicians. But the political framework itself is so dead and closed that people look to other sources, like artists, because art and music allow people a certain freedom. (Thom Yorke) <br />

Canada is one of the countries mentioned. The article mentions Canada&#8217;s liberal stance on such things as medical marijuana and gay marriage. It mentions that Canada is a popular country for Americans to &#8216;escape to&#8217; as it is close and that Canadians speak English. I guess the writer forgot to mention that the second largest province is French speaking. It is a good read &#8211; check it out here:</p>
<blockquote><p>
If Americans are leaving the United States, Canada is certainly one of the most convenient places to go. It may be a little chilly at times, but it&#8217;s right across the border and most Canadians speak English. Many of the major issues that divide people and political parties in the U.S. seem resolved in Canada. They have a lower crime rate, universal health care, and reportedly better education. Their medical doctors can dispense marijuana and last year they decided to officially recognize same-sex marriages. And, on top of all that, the rest of the world isn&#8217;t mad at them.<br />

It is a very good and enjoyable film. On Saturday night a few friends and I jumped into the car I had rented. We drove out to the suburbs and saw the movie in a huge movie complex. It sounds quite unappealing but it was actually quite fun. The movie was well worth the trip. It is nice to see that it is possible for Hollywood to make good films once in a while.</p>
<p>The plot is inventive and the actors do a good job playing the roles of the various goofy characters. I was especially impressed with Jim Carey. He does not play the wacky, over the top character he normally does. Even though there are funny points in the film, he is actually quite serious and does a good job playing Joel, a shy, and soulful person.</p>

<p>Well there seems to be another small art funding controversy in Canada. The news coverage of the Governor General&#8217;s Awards in several newspapers cites the controversial nature of one of this year&#8217;s winners. He is Istvan Kantor, you know, the guy who paints Xs on the walls of galleries and museums. I am not surprised by the media expressing surprise that an artist such as Kantor would win this 15 000 dollar award but at how superficial their coverage is. They make very little effort to see the work for what it is (to contextualize it). Here is a link to the CBC article (one of the more tame ones I came accross.
</p>
<blockquote><p>A performance artist who once lay naked in a shallow grave with a vial of his own blood dribbling out of his anus is among seven winners of one of Canada&#8217;s most prestigious visual arts awards this year.<br />

</p></div><div class='post'><h3>Serra and Richter Films at FIFA</h3><p>2004-03-28</p><p><p>This past Friday I went to see two films at <a href="http://www.artfifa.com" target="new">FIFA</a>. One was on Richard Serra and the other on Gerhard Richter. They were both quite refreshing as both of them featured the artists talking about their work.</p>
<p>The Serra film included showed the installation and subsequent planning of a huge peice that he installed on a farm in New Zealand. It is an impressive sculpture (from what I could tell from the film). Not only was the finished sculpture impressive but the planning that was required was very interesting to see. Serra often talks about his peices being a reaction to the landscape. While I do see this point I do think that his peices are a definite imposition on the same space. Not that an imposition is bad.</p>
<p>The film on Richter included interviews with him and other art historians and critics. Mostly, the critic and historians were quite annoying. Richter. however, talks about his work in a very simple and humble way. He mentions that he still does not know what his abstract paintings mean. Often artists seem to overwhelm their work with too many words to try and attempt to explain it. I think it is ok to not know what your own work means and at the same time see value in it and continue to make it.</p>

The Spanish fascist dictatorship led by General Franco was one of the most repressive regimes to have existed in Western Europe in the 20th Century. For every political assassination that took place under the Mussolini regime, Franco assassinated 10,000. The Franco dictatorship was established by the Armed Forces, the Church, the banking community, the large employers, the oligarchic land owners, and sectors of the middle class after a military coup took place in 1936 against a democratically elected government who had enacted major reforms that had injured the pro-Franco groups&#8217; interests.<br />
