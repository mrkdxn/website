The title is taken from a Chinese maxim and references landscape and the elements of nature as a primary source of artistic inspiration. The maxim well represents the artists’ approach to painting, all of which tend towards abstraction without, however, completely abandoning an evocation of landscape. </p>\n<p>In preparation for the exhibition, Dixon, Ronc and Worsnip met regularly to exchange ideas, report on their works in progress and to engage in and provoke a more profound reflection on an art practice that focuses on a theme as ancient as painting itself. The artists have sought in their works to evoke more than to represent, to question the illusory nature of pictorial space as well as to permit the co-existence of several visual languages. They also sought to bring particular attention to the tactile aspect of paint and colour as expressions of the link between landscape and the inner life of the psyche.</p>\n<p>La galerie McClure a le plaisir de présenter l’exposition Ni quitter ni coller des peintres Mark Dixon, Cécile Ronc et Sébastien Worsnip. Le titre de ce projet est issu d’une maxime chinoise et fait référence à la source d’inspiration première des artistes : le paysage et les éléments naturels. En effet, ceux-ci leur servent de prétextes à des explorations formelles qui tendent vers l’abstraction sans jamais quitter l’évocation du paysage. </p>\n<p>Dixon, Ronc et Worsnip se rencontrent régulièrement pour échanger sur leur travail. Il en ressort une importante réflexion sur des pratiques intéressées par un sujet aussi ancien que la peinture elle-même. Les artistes recherchent dans leurs œuvres : « […] à évoquer plutôt qu’à représenter, à figurer ; à suggérer des espaces multiples et contradictoires au sein d’un même espace pictural illusoire, à faire coexister plusieurs langages visuels, à accorder une attention particulière à l’aspect tactile de la peinture et une place privilégiée à la couleur comme expression des liens entre le paysage et la vie psychique…»</p>\n",

One highlight was the <a href=\"http://blackandwhiteartgallery.com/\">Black and White Gallery</a>.  The gallery has a great courtyard which had a very nice photo installed on the back wall (see right photo). </p>\n<p>Another interesting show was at <a href=\"http://www.damstuhltrager.com\">Dam Stuhltrager</a>.  Ryan Wolfe&#8217;s computerised grass blowing in the wind was simple and beautiful.

I am writing about this for a few reasons. One is the amount of money it comes with &#8211; $63 275.00 (in Canadian dollars), which is fairly substantial. The Canada Council reserves this type of support to senior artists. Another is that it seems she grew up in Canada (for some reason most of the articles mention this). And there is this scathing article thatnot only slams her art work but also the premise of the prize.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Mackie&#8217;s work would not make you look twice in a mediocre group show.</p></blockquote>\n<blockquote><p>It seems that the sillier art becomes, the more money gets thrown into its void. You know, some people actually do create works of art that are engaging, complex, and multi-layered.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I cannot remember the general tone of Jonathan Jones&#8217; previous reviews and/or articles but it makes me want to pay attention to his further writings.

Any semi-adept student or average commercial artist could have made them. Many do. But this isn&#8217;t what makes Hirst&#8217;s paintings sad; it only makes them ordinary and academic.<br />\nfrom <a href=\"http://www.artnet.com/Magazine//features/jsaltz/saltz4-6-05.asp\">The Emperor&#8217;s New Paintings by Jerry Saltz</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>it is not the avant garde aspect of his work that annoys me but the simplistic shock reaction that he seems to searh for. it is easy to shock and it is a one-liner. what is even worse is the art world&#8217;s taking of his work hook, line and sinker. not only is his work praised in many art theory books but his work sells very well. the works in this show go for between a quarter million and two million. not bad work if you can get it. why don&#8217;t these art collectors (speculators) look a bit more at less blue chip artist? spread the interest and wealth a bit. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Seeing Hirst rehash his old subjects in such pale ways is like listening to Paul McCartney sing Beatles songs in Wings.</p></blockquote>\n",

His gestural marks (that some people call doodles) are very immediate and casual. At the same time they are quite serious and create a situation of pause and reflection.  Randomness has interested me for quite some time. I do not refer to randomness in the sense of putting down whatever but more of a state where the discursive mind is less present. Perhaps openness is a better term. My work usually swings from randomness (gestural) to more contrived editing. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Nobody, however, could erect a theory on Twombly&#8217;s images.

That’s the first thing I want to say, and as it may turn out, the most radical, because he creates his color images without paint. Ashley uses HTML (hypertext markup language), the original and rudimentary instructional software of the internet, and delivers the results to his audience via the web. No brushes to clean. No walls to leave nail holes in. His studio/gallery is, in the parlance, a Blog, an online journal he maintains on a day to day basis.<br /><a href=\"http://www.chrisashley.net/weblog/archives/week_2004_10_10.html#000494\" target=\"new\">George Lawson: Chris Ashley’s HTML Drawings</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>I have always found that the physical aspect of my paintings to be very important (as most or all paintings). At the same time my paintings have been experienced only by seeing images on a screen. In fact I have sold paintings based on people viewing images on my web site. Perhaps the &#8216;flattening&#8217; of painting on the web happens with many other areas as well (journalism, literature, etc.).</p>\n<blockquote><p>There are philosophical implications to the virtual reality, the non-physical aspect of these HTML images. Rather than painting, one might call them coding, and one could ask angel-on-a-pinhead questions like, “What direction is the light coming from?” and, “How big are they?” They don’t conform to painting’s standard vocabulary, deriving their color as they do neither from mass tone nor undertone. </p></blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chrisashley.net/weblog/\">View examples of his HTML paintings here</a></p>\n",

Apparently he was busted and charged with 85 counts of public mischief. </p>\n<p>Zeke, of Zeke&#8217;s Gallery has started a (email) <a href=\"http://zekesgallery.blogspot.com/2004/12/free-roadsworth.html\" target=\"new\">campaign</a> to have  his interventions considered art and not common vandalism. It is an interesting debate &#8211; when does something become art and when is it graffiti? At the same time, part of what makes his art works interesting is that they <b>are</b> illegal and have to be made in a very covert way. The illegality of the work removes it from the institution of art (i.e. galleries or sanctioned art venue). I do not want him to get punished too harshly but at the same time I feel that having the city or the police sanction his interventions as Art will, for me, lessen the work. A large part of the impact is that it is rebellious, unsanctioned and clandestine. </p>\n<p>I really like his stencils and find that they are often very clever. It is nice when art interjects itself into common, pedestrian venues. There is an especially clever stencil on Fairmount, just east of St Laurent &#8211; a vine wraps around the shadow of a lampost (cast from a street light).</p>\n<p>As mentioned in the <a href=\"http://www.montrealmirror.com/2004/120904/front.html\" target=\"new\">Montreal Mirror</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The zipper on Parc above the interchange, the light switch on St-Laurent and St-Viateur, the vines at St-Urbain and St-Joseph; these are some of the unique signature pieces by Montreal stencil artist sensation Roadsworth.

The newspaper has openly declared their supprot for Kerry in the upcoming election (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/17/opinion/17sun1.html?ex=1255752000&#38;en=29df467441c52478&#38;ei=5088&#38;partner=rssnyt\">John Kerry for President</a>). To view these articles you will need to sign up (for free). This is an anecdote from the first mentioned story:</p>\n<blockquote><p>There is one story about Bush&#8217;s particular brand of certainty I am able to piece together and tell for the record.</p>\n<p>In the Oval Office in December 2002, the president met with a few ranking senators and members of the House, both Republicans and Democrats. In those days, there were high hopes that the United States-sponsored &#8221;road map&#8221; for the Israelis and Palestinians would be a pathway to peace, and the discussion that wintry day was, in part, about countries providing peacekeeping forces in the region. The problem, everyone agreed, was that a number of European countries, like France and Germany, had armies that were not trusted by either the Israelis or Palestinians. One congressman &#8212; the Hungarian-born Tom Lantos, a Democrat from California and the only Holocaust survivor in Congress &#8212; mentioned that the Scandinavian countries were viewed more positively. Lantos went on to describe for the president how the Swedish Army might be an ideal candidate to anchor a small peacekeeping force on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Sweden has a well-trained force of about 25,000. The president looked at him appraisingly, several people in the room recall.</p>\n<p>&#8221;I don&#8217;t know why you&#8217;re talking about Sweden,&#8221; Bush said. &#8221;They&#8217;re the neutral one. They don&#8217;t have an army.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Lantos paused, a little shocked, and offered a gentlemanly reply: &#8221;Mr. President, you may have thought that I said Switzerland. They&#8217;re the ones that are historically neutral, without an army.&#8221; Then Lantos mentioned, in a gracious aside, that the Swiss do have a tough national guard to protect the country in the event of invasion.</p>\n<p>Bush held to his view. &#8221;No, no, it&#8217;s Sweden that has no army.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The room went silent, until someone changed the subject.</p>\n<p>A few weeks later, members of Congress and their spouses gathered with administration officials and other dignitaries for the White House Christmas party. The president saw Lantos and grabbed him by the shoulder. &#8221;You were right,&#8221; he said, with bonhomie. &#8221;Sweden does have an army.&#8221; </p></blockquote>\n",

My idea is to continue with  this in a more regular manner. I will start a series of paintings and then photograph them. For each painting I will work out several (maybe 3) different avenues using PhotoShop. Readers (i.e. people like you) will then vote on which avenue they want the painting to continue in. This will be repeated until the &#8216;voters&#8217; decide that the painting is finished. I did something like this <a href=\"/images/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/on_paper/study_painting.html\">here</a>. </p>\n<p>There is something I really like about taking aesthetic judgement away from myself and letting it rest with the majority. It is true that it will not rest entirely with the voters as they will be presented with limited choices but it  could be an interesting exercise.

How nice that we are spared looking at the typical cheesy reproductions at these hotels.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Hotel art, once the mainstay of washed-out reproduced masterpieces and the butt of bad jokes, has recently acquired a bold new lease on life. Forget the Frette linens, celebrity chefs and Aveda bath products. To stay on top of the game, luxury high-end chains and boutique hotels must now provide their guests with cultural stimulation too, which is why a growing number of hoteliers in Canada and around the world are investing in serious modern-art collections to spice up their designer lobbies.</p></blockquote>\n",

Here is a better and more detailed description :</p>\n<blockquote><p>Summer long, the huge transformer of Hydro Québec, next to the Fonderie Darling, will be under close monitoring. The transformer generates a 60 cycle per second humm, the offical wavelength of the american power grid. This is the sound of electricity, the contemporary soundtrack of our domestic life.

The speakers are made of wood and have an organic feel to them. The main aspect of the work however is the sound element. The space (large and empty) is filled with the humming and droning of the waves the contraption is &#8216;catching&#8217;. At first it seems as though the sound of the waves&#8217; are regular but closer observation reveals that there are slight fluctuations. What I enjoyed most was the harmonics that are created with the overlapping of the deep bass tones (waves) with higher pitched ones. It reminded me of Tibetan throat singing. It was a nice thing to do during my lunch break. I think I should stop by La Fondarie more often, especially given that I work next door.</p>\n",

Their medical doctors can dispense marijuana and last year they decided to officially recognize same-sex marriages.

It is an impressive sculpture (from what I could tell from the film). Not only was the finished sculpture impressive but the planning that was required was very interesting to see. Serra often talks about his peices being a reaction to the landscape. While I do see this point I do think that his peices are a definite imposition on the same space. Not that an imposition is bad.</p>\n<p>The film on Richter included interviews with him and other art historians and critics. Mostly, the critic and historians were quite annoying. Richter. however, talks about his work in a very simple and humble way. He mentions that he still does not know what his abstract paintings mean. Often artists seem to overwhelm their work with too many words to try and attempt to explain it. I think it is ok to not know what your own work means and at the same time see value in it and continue to make it.</p>\n",
